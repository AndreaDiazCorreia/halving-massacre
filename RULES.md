# Halving Massacre: Game Rules with Example

## Objective
The game's goal is to be the last player standing by accumulating sats, thereby increasing your "bolt power," to avoid elimination and win the prize pool.

## Entry

- Participation: Open to anyone capable of sending sats via the Lightning Network.
- Zapping: Players join and strengthen their position by zapping sats to the game's vault.

## Bolt Power
- Represents the player's strength.
- Increases by zapping sats into the vault.
- Influences the odds of surviving elimination rounds.

## Elimination Rounds
- Frequency: Conducted every 10 Bitcoin blocks.
- Mechanism:
  1. The hash of a Bitcoin block determines winners and losers randomly.
  2. Half of the participants, rounded up, are eliminated based on their bolt power.
  3. Bolt power from eliminated players is redistributed among the remaining players (in equal share).

## Redistribution
The bolt power of eliminated players is divided equally among survivors.

## Continuous Participation
Surviving players can zap more sats to increase their bolt power in subsequent rounds until eliminated.

## Winning
- The game concludes when only one player remains, who then claims the entire prize pool.
- The finale coincides with a Bitcoin halving event, symbolizing the game's theme.

## Transparency and Fair Play
All transactions and bolt power levels are publicly visible.
No external manipulation of the game is allowed.

## Network Fees
Participants are responsible for any fees incurred from sending sats via the Lightning Network.

## Game Duration
The length of the game is determined by the number of players and the time between Bitcoin blocks.

## Example with 12 Players

### Initial Bolt Power Distribution
Players begin with bolt powers ranging from 500 to 6000 sats in increments of 500.

### First Elimination Round
- 6 players are randomly eliminated.
- The total bolt power of eliminated players (18,500 sats) is redistributed, giving the 6 survivors an extra 3000 sats each, rounded for simplicity.


### Updated Bolt Power After Redistribution
- Survivors now have bolt powers increased by a round number for simplicity, e.g., 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 sats.

### Continued Gameplay
- Surviving players may continue to zap sats to increase their bolt power in anticipation of future rounds.
- The game proceeds with eliminations and redistributions until a single winner emerges.
